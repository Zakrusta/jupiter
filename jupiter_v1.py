# ### TASK 1
# 
# Before exploring, there is a typo in the series for groups (Hamilia is wrong, Himalia is right) which only occured on the moon "Lysithea". This has been corrected during importing the data from the database

# In[379]:


import numpy as np
import math
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
"""at a glance, some points
have noted
-typo in name of group for one moon, "Lysithea", which was Hamilia instead of Himalia
-using the summary stats, we can calculate each group's summary statistics (seperated by each series (indicated by column))
-there should be a correlation between period and distance(moon to jupiter)(this is by Kepler's Third Law)
-the radius of moon is the only way to determine "size" of moon (mass of moon is missing, dataset is incomplete)"""
